    longDescription: "Aganitha’s MolConSUL (Molecular Conformer Search with Unsupervised Learning) is a state-of-the-art tool for rapidly generating stable conformer ensembles of drug-like molecules. By integrating advanced chemoinformatics, molecular mechanics, and unsupervised learning, MolConSUL outperforms traditional methods by producing fewer, yet more diverse and high-quality conformers that closely match both solid-state and protein-bound structures. It can generate conformers for any dielectric medium and excels with larger molecules (MW > 450 Da) such as PROTACs. Using only 20 final conformers, MolConSUL achieves ~96% acAganitha’scuracy (RMSD < 1 Å) in predicting solid-state conformers (mean RMSD = 0.26 Å) and ~85% accuracy for protein-bound conformers (mean RMSD = 0.44 Å) of drug-like molecules (QED score > 0.58). This innovative approach accelerates early-stage drug discovery processes, including virtual screening, crystal structure prediction, and property modeling."

It calculates a diverse set of molecular descriptors using advanced cheminformatics protocols—going well beyond standard RDKit properties—to enable accurate downstream property prediction using AI/ML models. These descriptors capture physicochemical, topological, and reactivity-relevant information, enhancing the modeling of key developability traits. Leveraging these computed features, MolScreener then applies medchem-informed filtering to assess whether a molecule is suitable as a small molecule (SMOL) drug, a PROTAC, or their fragments. This includes screening for problematic functional groups that could lead to assay interference (PAINS), toxicity, chemical instability, synthetic intractability, or promiscuous binding behavior. The result is a refined pool of candidates with higher medicinal chemistry quality and a better chance of success in experimental or iterative design workflows."
