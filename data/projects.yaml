    shortDescription: "Accelerated conformer generation for diverse drug-like molecules using unsupervised learning."
    longDescription: "Aganitha’s MolConSUL (Molecular Conformer Search with Unsupervised Learning) is a state-of-the-art tool for rapidly generating stable conformer ensembles of drug-like molecules. By integrating advanced chemoinformatics, molecular mechanics, and unsupervised learning, MolConSUL outperforms traditional methods by producing fewer, yet more diverse and high-quality conformers that closely match both solid-state and protein-bound structures. It can generate conformers for any dielectric medium and excels with larger molecules (MW > 450 Da) such as PROTACs. Using only 20 final conformers, MolConSUL achieves ~96% acAganitha’scuracy (RMSD < 1 Å) in predicting solid-state conformers (mean RMSD = 0.26 Å) and ~85% accuracy for protein-bound conformers (mean RMSD = 0.44 Å) of drug-like molecules (QED score > 0.58). This innovative approach accelerates early-stage drug discovery processes, including virtual screening, crystal structure prediction, and property modeling."
